# DH150 Assignment 6: Low Fidelity Prototype

### _by Alondra Orn // Digital Humanities 150 at UCLA, Spring 2020 // Dr. Sookie Cho // 5.13.2020


## Overview

**About:** I decided to change my project subject to "Blu-Collar" because it is my own personal passion project and I thought it would be very useful to apply my design knowledge from this class into a real world application. From this class, I thought it would be very useful to create the UI/UX deisgn for this comapny. I've been working for Bluecollar since the beginning of Witner quarter. It is a startup founded by college students and I joined because I know how academically, and financially challenging college can get, so I thought this app would be a great idea. It offers cleaning, delivery and laundry services for students who are too busy to do it themselves.

**Purpose:** The purpose of creating and testing this low-fidelity prototype is see whether the wireframe I have created is effcient, intutive and accessible to users. 

**User Personas:** 
1. Diana Chimp: A 19 year old Asian American at UCLA who is shy, reserved and impatient. Diana is a first year in college living on the dorms and she wants to get food from the dining halls, however, she is to shy to go out of her room and get it for herself. She wishes to have an online services get the food for her. However, she hopes that she is able to order ahead of time so that once she gets back from class she comes home to a nice warm dinner.
2. Maly Rodriogo: Maly is a graduate student at USC, she has a part time job while also being a single parent at home. Maly is hardworking however she doesn't have good time management skills. She hopes that she can find someone to do her laundry for her at a specific time while she takes care of the kids. 
3. Paula Oum:Is a 30 year old single mom working for a daycare. She lives in Long Beach, however her daughter goes to UCLA. She knows that her daughter isn't the cleansiest person and she wants to hire someone to clean up her room before she comes to vist her the following weekend. 

**Features & Tasks:** 
1. Order food from dining halls with special instructions to leave at a specific location
2. Show price and order summary 
3. Track progress of order 

## Wireframes & Wireflows

5 basic wireframes from this prototype are available to download in PDF form [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dgxJxHLlqSpeau1Mgt2NmtKaLJ491fEM/view?usp=sharing).

All wireframes and wireflows can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BiwPBoQVrLznBH7h3skdUHdgDHVBF0VkMs-a9-DKQRk/edit?usp=sharing).

### Notes on Wireflow Test

**Task 1: Order food from dining halls with special instructions to leave at a specific location**
>I noticed that the user was a bit confused in the beginning when asked (what I thought to be) the most simple task, to choose a parking area based on the price/particular amount of time provided. That led me to believe that maybe it is counterintuitive to provide the user with as much information as possible since that might make it more difficult to quickly make a decision. As seen in the second screen of this task, a more personalized experience might make the experience of the user more efficient. 

**Task 2: Look up price and order summary **
>I noticed that the user chose to click on very specific words within the “notifications” like “Learn more…” and “here” when it would have been satisfactory to click on the "notification" as a whole. This indicatest to me that word choice, and further on, font and adjustments to it (i.e. bolding) will be important in guiding the user to make the correct decision. Otherwise, this task seemed to be quite self-explanatory and the user completed all components quite quickly.

**Task 3: Track proggress of order**
>There was some confusion moving between two “interfaces” — the fact that it started at Google Maps (a generally familiar interface for the user) was not made fully clear by me. It was interesting that the user clicked on P for ParkMobile in the design, rather than the price or time frame, which is a good insight for demonstrating that user is attracted to the logo when it is in a different application interface.

The user successfully completed all components of all of the tasks in this low-fidelity prototype test. 

## Summary

Creating the low-fidelity prototype is what it seems most people imagine UX/UI design to be, so it was very interesting to finally reach this phase in the design process. I think the fact that I was simply creating new features for an existing application rather than completely ideating my own application did make this different from what I initially expected at the start of this class. 
I learned that preparing a low-fi prototype by hand is quite a repetitive process — while I was creating the wireframes, I was glad to be building off of the design of an existing application, but I also realized at a certain point that I may have been including too many details in the process. As such, I would definitely like to try my hand at digitizing this process in the future.
Testing the prototype in a paper-and-pencil environment was also quite a unique experience. Conceptually, I understood what needed to happen, but I did not want to guide the user too much with additional arrows or images that were part of the wireflow but not the wireframe. I feel that the user did not pay too much attention to the “click” indications and arrows that I did have present in the wireframes, though, so that part of the testing process went properly. 
Overall, I feel that creating digitized wireframes / wireflows would have allowed me to create and test more scenarios, screens, and steps more easily and may have provided a smoother experience for the test user. However, I feel that the testing that did occur was still beneficial for me because it highlighted the importance of small details for the user in deciding what to choose as their next step.
